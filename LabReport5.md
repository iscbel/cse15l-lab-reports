### 2: Response from the TA (mimicking a TA)
## Part 2: Reflection
During this quarter and my experience with CSE15-L, I learned quite a bit of useful techniques and such. Something I learned that completely changed the way I saw this class and other coding classes was when we wrote the script of the auto grader similar to how gradescope uses scripts as well to grade our PAs. At first I do admit it was pretty confusing but my TA was so awesome and helpful and guided me through the lab and I was able to finish writing a script for a basic grader!
