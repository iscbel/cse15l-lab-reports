## Part 1: Debugging Scenario
### 1: Student with a screenshot on EdStem
Here is a "student's" post on edstem regarding a bug they have in their code and they can't seem to explain why it is happening.

### 2: Response from the TA (mimicking a TA)
Response: I see you are having an issue of the file you are trying to compile not being found. I need to see more screenshots as to what files are in the directory you are currently in. There could be a lot of things causing the error that won't make the file compile and the most common one might be the directory you are currently in. Make sure you are keeping track of where you are in the directory as it can get confusing when using bash. I would be able to have a better understanding of your bug if you showed me the entirety of your code and the terminal alongside anything the explorer tab on visual studio code.

## Part 2: Reflection
During this quarter and my experience with CSE15-L, I learned quite a bit of useful techniques and such. Something I learned that completely changed the way I saw this class and other coding classes was when we wrote the script of the auto grader similar to how gradescope uses scripts as well to grade our PAs. At first I do admit it was pretty confusing but my TA was so awesome and helpful and guided me through the lab and I was able to finish writing a script for a basic grader!
