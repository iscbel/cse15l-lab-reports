## Lab Report 3
This lab report will be focusing on researching `find` command online. I will be finding 4 interesting command-line options or alternative ways to use the command `find`. 

## What is `find`?
Before researching different/ alternative ways of using the command. I do want to review, (mainly for my sake), the purpose of using `find` and how it can be useful. In general, the `find` command allows us to be able to search for files and directories. For example if I open up a terminal in `Visual Studios` and run the find command just by itself with nothing else attached, it will start searching through ALL of the files since I did not specify what I was trying to find.

This is just a small part of what bash was doing, I had to stop it from going through all the files because it was too much. 

So now lets try using `find` with a word attached to it to make it try finding more specific files/directories.
