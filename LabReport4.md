## Lab Report 4
In this lab report, I will be reproducing the tasks from the week 7 lab on my own starting from step 4 through 9. For each step, I will be showing a screenshot and writing down the keys that were pressed to get to that step.  

## Step 4: Log into ieng6
Starting from step 4, I log in to my `ieng6` account. 

I open up a new terminal using *`<ctrl><shift><backtick>`*

In case I forget how to log in to my `ieng6` account, I can go to [Lab Report 1](https://iscbel.github.io/cse15l-lab-reports/LabReport1.html#remotely-connecting-to-ieng6) and follow the instructions.
